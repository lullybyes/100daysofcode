Udemy 100 Days of Code Project
With the new year and new career path, I'm doing 100 days of code via Udemy Python projects. I will post projects here to keep me accountable. 

I work full time and I'm in an accelerated Bachelor's program so I won't be able to do my 100 days of code as consecutive days but I'll get it done!
